A
number
of
studies
have
demonstrated
that
long
treatment
of
both

nephrotoxicity

hypertension

and

Rapamycin
clinically
termed

as

SRL

structurally
similar
to
TAC
,
binds
to
same
binding
protein
FKBP
,
but
has
different
mechanism
of
action
[

.
Both
clinical
and
experimental
studies
demonstrated
that
SRL
when
used
either
with
CsA

alone
is
associated
with
side
effects
like
hyperlipidemia
,
thrombocytopenia
and
nephrotoxicity
[

SRL

they

i

uh

have
you
lived

<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
i

real

maybe

have
your

base
where
your

is

he
's
uh
yeah

it
's
uh
it
was
sixteen

<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
yeah
yeah
yeah
we
had
we
had
uh
summer
lasting
long
and
then
it
then
it
then
it
became
winter
like
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
um
-
hum
yeah
when
we
moved
into
our
house
i
just
hated
the
bushes
they
had
and
i
i
ripped
most
of
them
out
and
put
them
somewhere
in
the
back
and
put
new
ones
out
front
but
that
was
a

of
work
took
me
a

<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
yeah
i
'm
i
'm

so
i
have
n't
been
you
know
of
a
jury
eligible
age
for
very
long
um
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
yeah
the
the
the
problem
with
that
is
it
's
such
a
long
way
it
does
n't
ever
get
back
to
the
tenants
that
this
is
something
you
really
need
to
do
because
even
if
they
do
a
slight
rent
increase
it
's
so
small
and
over
such
a
long

of

that
no

notices
