some

great

my

sitting
in

of
living
room
,
when
uh
,
my
daddy
would
go
to
see
her
,
before
they
got
married
and
,
and
of
course
she
would
sit
there
until
they
leave
,
and
sometimes
she
would
act
as
though
she
was
sleeping
and
got
rather
quiet
,
she
would

<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
that
's
their
big
selling
point
uh
other
than
general

and
but
the
particular
seems
to
be
the
uh
the
quiet
ride

had
a
pretty
quiet
Christmas
at
our
house
this

one
of
the
things
that
we

putting
off
for

time
was
to
was
to
rent
all
of
the

you
know
i
used
to
do
that
for
my
dog
too
to
give
her
some
stimulation
but
she
did
n't
seem
to
appreciate
it
she
kind
of
likes
the
quiet
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
well
it
it
changes
it
could
be
a
quiet
week
it
could
be
the
kind
of
thing
where
kids
want
to
go
do
something
else
so
it
goes
pretty
quick
at
the
end
is
allowance
so
they
have
to
make
it
through
