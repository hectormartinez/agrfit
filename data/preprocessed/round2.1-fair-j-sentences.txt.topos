By
insisting
that
everything
Microsoft
has
done
is
fair
competition
,
they
risk
the
possibility
that
the

,
if
it

the
judge
's
finding
to
the
contrary
,
will
conclude
that
Microsoft
does

The
piece
is
scrupulously
fair

airing

concluding
that

may
not

But
when
it
comes
to
dictionaries
,
editors
appear
to
consider
them
fair
game
for
almost
anyone
,

they
often
assign
novelists
to
write
the
review

<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
But
there
is
a
difference
between
learning
about
them
and
trying
to
gain
fluency
in
them
:
I
think
I
know
a
fair
amount
about
many
languages
in
which
I
have
no
speaking
or
writing
ability
;
however
rewarding
fluency
in
them
might
be
for
aesthetic
reasons
(
to
read
their
literature
,
for
example
)
,
one
has
just
so
much
time
.
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
If
a
writer
is
,
by
definition
,
one
who
writes
a
fair
amount
and
does
so
professionally
(
for
which
read
"
gets
paid
for
it
"
)
,
I
suppose
I
can
call
myself
a
writer
.
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
In
fact
,
as
we
shall
see
,
natural
languages
contain
a
fair
amount
of
redundancy

<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
yes
i
i
think
they
can
probably
come
up
with
some
ways
to
insure
that
uh
you
know
people
would
get
a
fair
trial
and
not
have
to
go
through
this
process
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
of
someone
's
well
if
if
they
earn
a
great
deal
of
money
and
i
would
being
somewhere
in
the
middle
feel
like
that
it
would
be
a
lot
more
fair
to
have
a
little
more
heavily
weighted
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
are
so
protecting
what
they
have
in
the
budget
that
it
does
n't
seem
to
work
that
every
man
has
to
pay
his
own
fair
share
and
maybe
that
's
why
corporate
America
gets
away
with
what
they
're
doing
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
uh
but
when
they
revamped
the
you
know
supposedly
making
things
more
fair
um
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
i
think
that
i
think
it
would
be
fair
i
think
if
if
the
company
could
not
provide
it
all
on
their
own
for
the
for
the
people
that
would
be
using
it
you
know
a
certain
amount
of
their
salary
would
go
to
it
but
it
would
still
probably
be
cheaper
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
you
know
i
'm
i
'll
be
honest
with
you
it
takes
a
fair
amount
to
offend
me
and
sometimes
i
go
to
these
movies
and
they
've
got
just
this
gratuitous
uh
uh
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
uh
yeah
a
big
chunk
of
it
's
word
processing
we
're
also
taking
programming
classes
and
uh
so
there
's
a
fair
amount
of
programming
getting
done
on
it
but
uh
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
yeah
uh
originally
i
'm
from
West
Virginia
we
got
a
pretty
fair
amount
of
snow
but
uh
i
got
down
here
in
June
of
eighty
four
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
which
i
thought
was
fair
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
yeah
yeah
well
with
this
well
they
classify
it
as
computer
engineering
technology
so
i
'm
getting
a
fair
amount
of
programming
as
well
as
electronics
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
it
would
n't
be
fair
to
um
like
with
say
lower
class
people
who
do
n't
make
as
much
money
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
it
's
not
it
's
not
fair
to
just
kind
of
do
everything
all
the
same
with
all
guns
because
they
're
not
all
the
same
you
know
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
well
sometimes
sometimes
the
sentencing
is
still
is
not
fair
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
i
i
think
that
's
true
i
can
remember
times
my
parents
would
say
well
what
do
you
think
would
be
a
fair
punishment
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
yes
other
than
nuking
it
um

uh
