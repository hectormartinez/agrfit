The
concept
of
lung
fibroblasts
as
effector
cells
in
the
pathogenesis
of
idiopathic
pulmonary
fibrosis
(
IPF
)
has
recently
evolved
[

]
.
Lung
fibroblasts
respond
,
in
vitro
,
to
inflammatory
cytokines
by
producing
growth
factors
and
collagen
,
resulting
in
fibroblast
proliferation
and
extracellular
matrix
deposition
[

]
.
In
addition
,
activated
lung
fibroblasts
have
been
shown
to
produce
large
amounts
of
inflammatory
cytokines
and
chemokines
,
in
vitro
,
and
hence
,
these
cells
may
also
have
a
role
as
effector
-
inflammatory
cells
[

]
.
This
capacity
to
produce
both
inflammatory
and
fibrotic
factors
could
mean
that
phenotypically
altered
lung
fibroblasts
act
simultaneously
as
effector
and
target
cells
,
via
paracrine
and
autocrine
mechanisms
,
perpetuating
the
fibrotic
process

Furthermore

we
