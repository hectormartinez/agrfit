The

,
a
massive

written
between

by
Sabine
Baring

Gould
(
1834

It
also—not

that
it
is
a

One
day
during
a
university
English
class
,
a
very
discomfited
student
,
after
frantic
and
obtrusive
dictionary
work
,
handed
a
colleague
of
mine
a
scrap
of
paper
.
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
At
the
level
of
molecular
autonomous
agents
,
I
made
the
point
repeatedly
that
work
is
the
constrained
release
of
energy
and
that
autonomous
agents
do
carry
out
work
to
construct
the
constraints
on
the
release
of
energy
such
that
the
energy
is
released
along
specific
channels
and
such
that
specific
couplings
of
nonequilibrium
energy
sources
to
propagating
organization
arise
.
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
The
prestige
associated
with
publishing
in
a
selective
journal
is
sufficiently
valuable
that

generally
willing

abdicate

legal
rights
to
their
own
work
without
remuneration
.

The

The
Great
Work

<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
This
raises
an
interesting
question
for
the
biology
community
:
In
a
field
in
which
scientific
contributions
have
long
been
judged
in
terms
of
the
amount
of
new
experimental
data
they
contain
,
how
does
one
judge
work
that
is
primarily
focused
on
interpreting
(
albeit
with
great
effort
and
sophistication
)
the
experimental
data
of
others
?
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
Third
,
the
record
may
go
out
of
date
,
so
that
work
can
no
longer
be
extracted
by
reference
to
the
record
.
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
Thus
,
in
the
present
work
we
attempted
to
study

the
distribution

bodies

neurokinin
in
the
human
brainstem
,
using
an
immunoperoxidase
technique
,
and
to
compare
our
findings
with
the
distribution
of
other
tachykinins
previously
described
in
the
human

Finally

we

GAO
's

policies

apply
to
all

A
further
partial
prototype
is
present
in
chapter
,
with
its
discussion
of
autonomous
agents
as
self
-
reproducing
physical
systems
that
do
successfully
measure
displacements
from
equilibrium
and
do
successfully
evolve
to
couple
exergonic
and
endergonic
reactions
to
achieve
completed
work
cycles
.
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
In
turn
,
this
led
me
to
wonder
about
the
relation
between
the
emergence
of
constraints
in
the
universe
and
in
a
biosphere
,
and
the
diversification
of
patterns
of
the
constrained
release
of
energy
that
alone
constitute
work
and
the
use
of
that
work
to
build
still
further
constraints
on
the
release
of
energy
.

<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
It
reappears
in
the
work
of
contemporary
Classicists
such
as
Allan
Greenberg
.
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
We
have
arrived
at
this
:
An
autonomous
agent
,
or
a
collection
of
them
in
an
environment
,
is
a
nonequilibrium
system
that
propagates
some
new
union
of
matter
,
energy
,
constraint
construction
,
measurement
,
record
,
information
,
and
work
.
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
It
turns
out
that
the
work
that
must
be
done
,
hence
the
energy
utilized
,
equals
the
work
that
can
later
be
extracted
from
the
system
after
the
fast
and
slow
particles
are
separated
into
the
two
boxes
.
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
The
concepts
of
atoms
in
motion
in
three
-
dimensional
space
do
not
appear
to
entail
the
concepts
of
an
autonomous
agent
,
self
-
consistent
constraint
construction
,
release
of
energy
,
propagating
work
tasks
,
and
the
closure
of
catalysis
,
tasks
,
and
other
features
that
constitutes
the
propagating
organization
that
is
an
autonomous
agent
or
a
coevolving
ecology
of
autonomous
agents
.
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
For
prehospital
work
,
this
finding
is
important
because
it
shows
that
GCS
does
not
deviate
significantly
either
from
the
MEES
scale
(
which
has
more
parameters
)
or
from
the
APACHE
II
scale
(
which
is
measured
in
hospital
)
.
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
Because
writing
an
unfavorable
review
of
a
(
bad
)
feminist
book
would
be
tantamount
to
treachery
,
such
books
are
often
unjustifiably
praised
,
as
was
the
case
with
this
work
by
Rosalind
Miles
,
which
was
well
received
on
its
publication
in
June
.
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
It
sometimes
takes
work
to
construct
constraints
,
and
it
takes
constraints
to
get
work
.

To
understand
the
potential
,
and
the
limitations
,
of
fMRI
,
it
's
helpful
to
know
how
the
technique
works
.
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
It
is
crucial
to
the
strategic
planning
process
to
measure
the
volume
of
our
grantees
work
and
to
evaluate
the
success
of
their
approaches
.

The
Center
constructs
a
file
of
medical
records
in
a
standardized
,
subdivided
sequence
(
hospital
admission
notes
and
discharge
summaries
;
neurologic
consultation
notes
;
reports
of
computed
tomographic
and
magnetic
resonance
imaging
of
the
head
;
reports
of
imaging
of
the
heart
by
transthoracic
and
transesophageal
echocardiography
;
copies
of
electrocardiograms
;
reports
of
imaging
of
cervicocephalic
vasculature
by
angiography
using
conventional
,
computed
tomographic
,
or
magnetic
resonance
techniques
or
by
ultrasonography
;
and
reports
of
blood
work
)
.
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
The
process
was
not
in
operation
during
the
site
visit
,
so
current
work
practices
were
not
observed
.
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
Some
machines
have
an
automatic
thread
-
trimmer
to
do
this
step
;
if
not
,
then
the
threads
must
be
cut
and
the
finished
work
put
in
an
appropriate
pile
to
be
tied
together
when
all
the
pieces
of
the
bundle
have
been
finished
.
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
During
the
course
of
this
work
,
three
new
Cre
reporter
strains
that
conditionally
express
EGFP
were
reported
.
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
But
I
was
actually
asked
by
my
friend
at
work
,
who
said
to
me
,
would
you
be
interested
in
having
the
ACLU
contact
you
,
and
I
said
yes
.
<SENTENCEBOUNDARY>
The

someone
